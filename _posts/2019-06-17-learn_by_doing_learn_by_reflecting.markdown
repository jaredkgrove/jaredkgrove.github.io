I chose [wikihow.com](http://www.wikihow.com) to scrape for my first Flatiron project. Their mission statement is "We're trying to help everyone on the planet learn how to do anything. Join us." Although the website is not specifically a programming resource, the emphasis on learning and collaboration resonates with my understanding of coding communities and with my personal journey learning through and beyond Flatiron. My first project went about as well as I could have hoped (pending project review). Admittedly, I often learn the most when things don't go well, but as I reflect on this project I still had several key points of learning that I'd like to take with me from my first project.

After deciding on wikihow.com, I set about preparing for my project planning meeting. Even though I have been dabbling in programming for several years and have created a number of small programs and apps, I had never truly planned out a program before creating it. I would just start writing code and find my way as I went. I'd always learn a lot as I stumbled through refactor after refactor (a word I did not know) and I usually came out on the other side with a decent application. But the time and energy saved by having a plan for my classes and interface can't be overstated. In retrospect, this probably should have been obvious after my first few programs, but better a late learner than a never learner. That's not to say everything went according to plan for my first project, but when a challenge arose it was much easier to understand the implications and possible solutions when there was a plan to modify.

Another helpful practice I hope to make a habit was that of generally working from front to back. For this project, that meant initially setting up my CLI class to function how I wanted by using dummy data and worrying about how I'd get the real data after I had a basic setup for my CLI class. In the past, I typically began a program by working on the code I thought would be the most challenging or the part I was most excited about. Again, there were some short term advantages to those approaches, but I really loved the natural flow of working backward and the clarity that came with already knowing how I was going to use the data I needed to collect. 

My last take away from this project is to embrace the unexpected challenges rather than growing (too) frustrated. I didn't expect to have to have to return only html tags that were immediate children of another tag while scraping a website to make my program work how I wanted  (using ">"). And I didn't expect it to take 5 hours to correctly figure out how to do something that seemed so simple from a logic perspective, especially when my mental resume has "super good at google" as my top skill. I could have given in and compromised on how my program functioned (it was only for the sake of formatting after all), but I didn't and now I'm a lot more confident in my ability to scrape a website, even if it is laid out in a challenging way. 

One of my main reasons for joining Flatiron was not just to learn how to code (which I had been teaching myself for years), but to develop the habits and practices of a professional programmer. I am excited to see how I am already taking strides toward those goals with the help of Flatiron.
