I somewhat nervously made the decision to be ambitious with my models and associations. 7 models with 3 join tables. Probably not a record, but it was new territory for me as I had mostly worked with 2-3 models. Courts, players, games, squads, favorites, squad_players, and game_players. I was creating an app where users (players) can organize and join pick-up games of basketball at their local courts. It's an app I wish existed (full disclosure: I haven't actually looked yet), which made me excited for the challenge.

I had a drive from Chicago to Minneapolis to kick off my project work and I decided to focus solely on setting up my models and associations (the real hero of this story is my wife who drove the whole way). I think I would have been lost without those six hours on the backend. I'm usually tempted to jump ahead and find my mistakes while working on my routes and views, but things went so much smoother having put the effort in up front... er.. back. 

My back-end work up front was the most clear example of a bigger lesson I'm learning that I am much more productive when I take the time to step back and plan my work ahead of time. I have a habit of chasing bugs and features on a whim without thinking about where I want to get to in the end, which often leads to me chasing my tail as I make changes for one feature without consideration for another one. My dad always said that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. It turns out he was right, which is super annoying.
