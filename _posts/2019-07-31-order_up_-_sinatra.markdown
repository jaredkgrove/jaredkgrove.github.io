I like food. I like *good* food. And I don't like spending money often. So when I go out to eat I want the best thing (value considered) on the menu. I don't want to be looking around at what others ordered with buyer's remorse. To drive the point home, I was on a date at the Cheesecake Factory earlier this year (with my intelligent, powerful, beautiful wife-friend) and they have about 200 items on the menu. How to decide?! Websites like Yelp and others are great at pointing you to the right restaurant, but it's much more difficult to find recommendations for what to order once you get there. This is where my idea for the Menu Reviewer web app was born. 

I didn't have to think too long to come up with an idea for my Sinatra project. The Menu Reviewer fit the requirements perfectly. This app allows Users to read and write reviews for specific menu items, so they know what to order and what to avoid at their favorite (or not) restaurants. And even though it is a long way from being a deployable modern web app, it was exciting to use the programming skills I've acquired to create an app on such a familiar platform (web browser). 

The most difficult/useful part of the project for me was putting together all the concepts I had learned since the last project. I felt like I had a good grasp of each concept as I was learning it but it is much more challenging putting it all together. User athentication, RESTful routes, separation of concerns with MVC, ERB, ActiveRecord, and much more. Completing this project definitely increased my confidence and understanding of those topics and I'm excited for what is next!
