"What do you want to be when you grow up?" That was the question asked to my 5-year-old self. Not really knowing what I wanted to do after my professional sports career(s), I responded with a simple question. "I like to build stuff, who does that?" Mechanical engineers do. I honestly gave very little thought to the matter after that conversation and 18 years later I graduated with my BS in Mechanical Engineering (the sports thing didn't work out). 

I'm not here to talk about mechanical engineers; they do all sorts of cool and useful things. I'm thankful for the things I learned as an ME and for the ways I learned how to learn, but I found myself more often than not bored and disatisfied with both my career and my career path; with one notable exception. I had started teaching myself to program. It started with the realization that I spent a significant portion of my time being paid to copy/paste numbers and format spreadsheets. There *had* to be a better way. I began by writing simple excel macros to automate the spreadsheets I was using. It was nice to see some of my tedious responsibilities completed in a matter of seconds, but it was exhilarating that I had built the thing that did it. 

From that point on, I looked for every opportunity to use programming to make my job (and the jobs of my coworkers) more efficient and more accurate. I created more and bigger programs in Excel VBA. I got my hands on a copy of Visual Studio 2005 (the year was 2015 by the way) from our lone programmer. And, despite many set-backs and a lot of advocating, successfully got some of the programs I built implemented into our engineering processes. I loved it. Every discovery opened my mind to new possibilities: variables, methods, functions, classes, object orientation! I figured out quickly that if I could imagine something built with logical steps, then there was a way to program it. I just needed to Google and persevere. 

Fast forward 3 years and I was still working the same job, still largely uninspired. I had grown much as a programmer. I was getting pretty good at envisioning and creating functioning and reliable programs. At the same time, I was reluctantly accepting the reality that I wasn't going to be able to shift into a role that allowed me to program as much as I wanted. Even more dissapointing, I realized that I wasn't marketable as a programmer. I knew I had the mind and the passion for it, but even I had to admit that my experience with modern technologies was lacking. And even though I had grasped and utilized some advanced concepts, my self-taught curriculum was lacking in some of the basics; prioritizing function over good practice and collaboration. 

I'd had enough. I spent a week researching how best to start a career in programming and I applied to the Software Engineering bootcamp through Flatiron School. I could not be more excited for this leap into the world of software devolopement. It's been 23 years since I decided to be a mechanical engineer and now I've decided to be a software developer. Because I like to build stuff.
